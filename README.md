# Brick Breaker
Follow along as I learn how to use the HTML5 canvas to write games in vanilla JavaScript. More info at [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/beaucarnes/intro-to-game-development-with-javascript--pqogm3nsF).

## Build Automation
We're going a bit deeper than **just** vanilla Javascript. You'll notice a `gulpfile.js`, and `package-lock.json` and `package.json`. We're using `npm` to include the [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) build tool into our project.

## Deployment
Clone or fork this repo and `cd` to its directory. From there, run `npm install` to grab the dependencies. Once Node downloads everything for you, run `gulp watch`. This will start up a server for you at `http://localhost:3000`. As an added bonus, any changes you make to any `.css`, `.js`, or the `index.html` file will automatically trigger a server reload and your changes will immediately be rendered in the browser!

## Contributing
This is not my original work. I am following a tutorial to learn about game development on the web. If you want to contribute to the parent project, please do so at the Free Code Camp link above!
